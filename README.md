# Genesis
Genesis is a computational artificial-life simulator where organisms evolve executable genomes on a custom virtual machine.

## Features
- Digital organisms represented as autonomous agents
- Genomes modeled as executable instruction sequences
- Mutation, reproduction, and inheritance mechanisms
- Resource-limited spatial environment
- Population-level metrics observable during simulation

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the simulator: `python3 main.py`
> Full-screen terminal is recommended for proper display.
