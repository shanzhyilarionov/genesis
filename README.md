# GENESIS
GENESIS is a computational artificial-life simulator where organisms evolve executable genomes on a custom virtual machine.

## Features
- Agent-based predator-prey dynamics
- Heritable genetic mutation and variation
- Custom virtual machine for genome execution
- Lifespan, energy, and metabolism constraints
- Configurable 2D grid environment and parameters
- Terminal-based visualization with live statistics

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the simulator:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

*Full-screen terminal is recommended for proper display.*
